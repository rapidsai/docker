# Install deps for all pkgs and remove the pkgs that were installed due to
# cross library deps. Also do not clean/chmod at end to save time as the
# notebook conda install will do the needed cleanup

# FIXME: gdal should not need to be listed. This is needed since cuspatial=0.11
# has builds both with and without gdal as a dep, and conda favors versions
# (assuming they satisfy the version spec) that have fewer deps. The alternative
# is to explicitly install cuspatial with a tight version spec: >=0.11.0a191105
